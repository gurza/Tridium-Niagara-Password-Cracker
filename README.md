# Tridium Niagara Password Cracker
By VenomInfoSec


## Purpose
An online password cracker that brute forces passwords for the Tridium Niagara platform.
* Hydra didn't work with the target due to multiple redirects, custom encoding scheme, and CSRF tokens.
* Currently only supports HTTP but the testCreds() method can be modified to support HTTPS since it just uses the requests module
